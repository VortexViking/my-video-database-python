# Video Database Python

This project is a simple Python script that creates a video database interface for managing YouTube playlists.

## Features

- Displays an ASCII art title for "Video Database"
- Stores YouTube playlist links in a dictionary
- Prints a list of available playlists with color-coded URLs

## How it works

1. The script starts by defining ANSI color codes for blue text and color reset.
2. It then prints a large ASCII art title for "Video Database".
3. A dictionary named `playlists` is defined, containing playlist names as keys and their corresponding YouTube URLs as values.
4. The script then prints a prompt asking the user to choose a playlist.
5. Finally, it iterates through the `playlists` dictionary, printing each playlist name followed by its URL (colored in blue for better visibility).


## Usage

To run the script, follow these instructions based on your operating system:

### Windows

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script
3. Run the following command: python the-database.py


### macOS and Linux

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script
3. Run the following command: python3 the-database.py


Note: If you have multiple Python versions installed, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python` on all operating systems to ensure you're using Python 3.

If you encounter a "command not found" error, make sure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH.

This will display the list of available playlists with their URLs.
